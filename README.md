Everyone is aware of the environmental problems are rising day by day. The emission from the tailpipe of the internal combustion engine vehicles is one of the major causes of environmental problems; especially air pollution and a decline in natural resources used to power an IC engine vehicle.  To meet these global issues many countries have taken the initiative to promote electricity-powered vehicles that do not release any gases from the exhaust. Electric vehicles run by an electronic motor that gets power from the onboard battery packs that are charged when the vehicle is still.  Owing a battery-powered vehicle can be way too expensive as compared to an internal combustion engine vehicle. Kipping this into consideration the Indian government has stepped forward and allowed to make changes in your car to convert it to green mobility by certified companies.  If you have a conventional IC engine car whose engine becomes obsolete and you want to be rid off of it, or you want it to be there for a few more years. However, you can get it converted to a green car or electric car. Converting your scrap car to an electric car will surely cost you less than buying a new car, and contributing to saving the environment from pollution.
